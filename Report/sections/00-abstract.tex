    This laboratory exercise examines how consumer smartphones process raw GNSS measurements under both stationary and motion conditions, and evaluates the impact of imposed spoofed location inputs and timing delays on computed navigation solutions. 
    Leveraging open-source filtering and weighted least-squares estimation, we measure deviations in reported fixes and identify key factors—geometry shifts, signal strength fluctuations, and clock behavior—that influence accuracy. 
    Our findings underscore strategies for detecting anomalous GNSS outputs on mobile devices.
