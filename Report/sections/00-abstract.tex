    This study explores the behavior of GNSS navigation on a commercial Android smartphone by analyzing raw measurements collected in both static and dynamic conditions. Using Google's GNSS Logger and MATLAB-based post-processing, we evaluate positioning accuracy, signal quality, and clock stability under normal operation and under spoofed inputs—where false positions and delays are injected into the data. The results highlight the vulnerability of smartphone GNSS to software spoofing and underline diagnostic features that may aid in anomaly detection and robustness improvement.
