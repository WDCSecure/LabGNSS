    This study explores the behavior of GNSS navigation on a commercial Android smartphone by analyzing raw measurements collected in both static and dynamic conditions. 
    Using Google's GNSS Logger and MATLAB-based post-processing, we evaluate PVT (Position, Velocity and Time), signal quality, and clock stability under normal operation and under spoofed inputsâ€”where false positions and delays are injected into the data. 
    The results highlight the vulnerability of smartphone GNSS to software spoofing and underline features that may aid in anomaly detection.
