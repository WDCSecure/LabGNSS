    This study explores the behavior of GNSS navigation on a commercial Android smartphone by analyzing raw measurements collected in both static and dynamic conditions. 
    Using Google's GNSS Logger and MATLAB-based post-processing, we evaluate PVT (Position, Velocity and Time), signal quality, and clock stability under normal operation, under spoofed inputs (false positions/delays), and interference. 
    The results highlight vulnerabilities to software spoofing—positional errors with minimal signal-quality degradation— and tracking instability caused by interference.
