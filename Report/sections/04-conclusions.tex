\section{CONCLUSIONS} \label{sec:conclusions}

    This research compared GNSS performance on a commercial smart-phone under static, dynamic, and spoofed scenarios based on raw measurements and post-processing in MATLAB. Under the static scenario, the device had consistent position estimates, low clock drift, and negligible variation in pseudorange and speed. The dynamic scenario, on the other hand, demonstrated higher noise in position, pseudor-range rates, and clock biasâ€”predictable effects of motion and satellite geometry variations.
    The spoofing tests indicated that even basic, software-level injec-arise in the form of taking on false coordinates by the GNSS solver, as it settles on a consistent but incorrect position with little or no impact on first-order signal measurements like carrier-to-noise ratio or HDOP. This highlights a significant vulnerability: smartphone GNSS receivers can be fooled without revealing obvious degradations in signal quality. Some of these potential future extensions are experiments across devices, 
    applying real-time mechanisms to identify spoofing, and using inertial or multi-constellation data for verification. These steps would push the boundaries of GNSS robustness and help in the development of more robust location-aware systems.
